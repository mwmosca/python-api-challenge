# python-api-challenge

Module 6 Challenge submission

WeatherPy.ipynb and VacationPy.ipynb are both derived from their corresponding starter code files. The code was tested using the provided output data. New output data was generated for the submission.

For Step 2 in VacationPy.ipynb the ideal cloudiness conditions were increased from 0 to < 10 to get more results in the ideal_city_df dataframe.

An API key for OpenWeather is required to run WeatherPy.ipynb.
An API key for Geoapify is required to run VacationPy.ipynb.

Create a new file named api_keys.py and add the following code:

# OpenWeatherMap API Key
weather_api_key = 'Your OpenWeather API key'

# Geoapify API Key
geoapify_key = 'Your Geoapify API key'
